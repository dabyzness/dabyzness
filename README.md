- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Damian Bzdyra @dabyzness
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m creating things that I think are fun and artsy. They serve some type of use for me, but ultimately it's more about the journey than the destination. Even if I don't end up using the final result as I originally intended, I will have learned many things along the way. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React and NginX. I'm going to try hosting my most recent project on its own server and domain when completed. It's kind of pointless since it can just run on a localhost, but I think it would be a neat thing to learn.
- Hopefully afterwards I can develop a personal website and show off my projects there.

-   LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/in/bzdyrad
-   Email: bzdyrad@gmail.com

- Actively searching for a job.
